# How to Detect Cryptocurrency Miners? By Traffic Forensics! <br/>Veselý V. & Žádník, M. for Digital Investigation
In order to verify and reproduce results outlined in the paper, we publicly disclose all our materials including source-codes and datasets. This repository contains following folders:


## sMaSheD
This folder offers database dump including all mining servers, pools, IP addresses, ports and checking history relevant for the end of May 2018 in subfolder `sql`. Moreover, it has a snapshot of the system related to article content in `src` and `zip`.

## sMaSheD-devel
Submodule pointing to the newest version of sMaSheD source-codes.

## PCAPs and CGMiner
All PCAP files related mostly to a development of mining server catalogue are located in `PCAPs`. The folder `CGMiner` includes mining software configs and outputs employed for testing of sMaSheD results.

## WEKA-CSV
CSV files containing feature vectors that are ready for Weka tool.
File wekaready_miners.csv contains feature vectors of positive samples, i.e. of miners.
File wekaready_notminers.csv contains feature vectors of negative samples, i.e. of not-miners.

The feature vector consists of the following features in this order:
1. ackpush/all - Number of flows with ACK+PUSH flags to all flows
2. bpp - Bytes per packet per flow per all flows
3. ppf - Packets per flow per all flows
4. ppm - Packets per minute
5. req/all - Request flows to all flows (request flow is considered a flow where src port is greater than dst port)
6. syn/all - Number of flows with SYN flag to all flows
7. rst/all - Number of flows with RST flag to all flows
7. fin/all - Number of flows with FIN flag to all flows
7. class - miner or notminer
